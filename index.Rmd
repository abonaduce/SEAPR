# Sea Level Change: Earth system feedback

**Sea-level** variability is **characterized** by multiple **interacting components of the Earth system** (i.e.
atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere) that act over a wide spectrum of temporal and spatial scales
Therefore, **sea-level research** must follow a **multidisciplinary** approach as it requires **multiple
skills** to capture the cascade of processes characterizing the **global and regional sea-level** variability and
trends.

The accurate estimate of the components contributing to the **global sea-level** and their **role/impact at the regional scales** is recognized by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as one of the **priorities for climate research** duringthe next decades, with a large **societal benefit and impact**. Sea level is an essential climate variable (ECV) and considered a **key climate indicator** and at the same time represents one of the largest societal **concerns about climate change**, because of the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the large human population inhabiting the coastal regions and the loss of natural resources.


# Purpose of the Workshop 

**Research on sea-level change** is challenging and requires cross-disciplinary skills to account for the unresolved feedbacks of the Earth system at the broad range of temporal and spatial scales.  

The **BCCR** and its partners **offer the scientific framework** to meet such a challenge. This workshop initiative aims to define and implement such a framework for sea-level research.

The overall objective of the workshop is to **foster the collaboration** between the different partners of the BCCR on sea-level research and to set-up a **Sea-level Research Group**.  

Look at the workshop [Concept Note](concept.hml) for further details.
