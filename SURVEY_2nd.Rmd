## Sessions

### Specify which **Sessions** were of major interest to you

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
DATA <- read.csv("OUT_SESSIONS.csv")
q <- DATA$q
perc <- DATA$f
df <- data.frame(q=q,perc=perc)
p <- plot_ly(df,x = ~perc, y = ~q, type = 'bar',
       name = ~q, color = ~q) %>%
       layout(yaxis = list(title = ''), xaxis = list(title = '(%)'), barmode = 'stack', margin = list(l = 300, r = 10, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 4))
p <- hide_legend(p)

p
```

## Gaps

### In the framework of a Sea Level Research Group, did you find any knowledge **gaps?**

* Several

* Modelling **glacial isostatic adjustment**, Modelling **mountain glacier contribution** to present and future sea-level**

* **Tidal** modelling, **GIA** modelling

* I think there were experts in every field, but **scattered**

* Assesment of **vertical land movements** (not only GIA) for relative sea-level change**

* **Tidal** and high resolution **coastal modelling**

* We do not have competence within the field of **glacioisostatic modelling** and also **GPS/sealevel measuring (Kartverket/Map Authority)**


## Strategy to fill Gaps

### Which is the best **strategy to fill those gaps?**

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
DATA <- read.csv("OUT_STRATEGY.csv")
q <- DATA$q
perc <- DATA$f
df <- data.frame(q=q,perc=perc)
p <- plot_ly(df,x = ~perc, y = ~q, type = 'bar',
       name = ~q, color = ~q) %>%
       layout(yaxis = list(title = ''), xaxis = list(title = '(%)'), barmode = 'stack', margin = list(l = 300, r = 10, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 4))
p <- hide_legend(p)

p
```

## Target

### Can you identify **priority areas to be targeted** by a Sea Level Research Group?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
DATA <- read.csv("OUT_TARGET.csv")
q <- DATA$q
perc <- DATA$f
df <- data.frame(q=q,perc=perc)
p <- plot_ly(df,x = ~perc, y = ~q, type = 'bar',
       name = ~q, color = ~q) %>%
       layout(yaxis = list(title = ''), xaxis = list(title = '(%)'), barmode = 'stack', margin = list(l = 300, r = 10, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 4))
p <- hide_legend(p)

p
```

* "I HAVE JUST MARKED BY OWN RESEARCH PRIORITIES. I AM NOT CONVINCED THE SLR GROUP SHOULD HAVE AN OVERALL RESEARCH PRIORITY. PEOPLE SHOULD WORK ON WHATEVER THEY ARE WORKING ON AND USE THE GROUP TO FIND POSSIBLE COLLABORATIONS"

* "BROADEN THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND REPRESENT SL RESEARCH IN THE LARGER BJERKNES COMMUNITY"


## Your Study

### Can you tell more about your idea for a **collaborative sea-level study**

* **Downscaling of the NorESM sea level projection** using observations, the reanalyses and projections of sea level (TOPAZ and NorCPM respectively)

* I think **collaboration will come naturally** in this group of people sharing ideas

* **Modulation of extreme sea levels by interannual/decadal variability** and the evaluation of hindcasts with respect to predicting this variability


## Funding Line

### Which could be the most appropriate **funding line for your study**?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
DATA <- read.csv("OUT_FUNDING_LINE.csv")
q <- DATA$q
perc <- DATA$f
df <- data.frame(q=q,perc=perc)
p <- plot_ly(df,x = ~perc, y = ~q, type = 'bar',
       name = ~q, color = ~q) %>%
       layout(yaxis = list(title = ''), xaxis = list(title = '(%)'), barmode = 'stack', margin = list(l = 300, r = 10, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 4))
p <- hide_legend(p)

p
```

## Funding Strategy

### Which is your preferred **funding strategy**?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
DATA <- read.csv("OUT_FUNDING_STRATEGY.csv")
q <- DATA$q
perc <- DATA$f
df <- data.frame(q=q,perc=perc)
p <- plot_ly(df,x = ~perc, y = ~q, type = 'bar',
       name = ~q, color = ~q) %>%
       layout(yaxis = list(title = ''), xaxis = list(title = '(%)'), barmode = 'stack', margin = list(l = 300, r = 10, b = 50, t = 50, pad = 4))
p <- hide_legend(p)

p
```
